# python-keylogger-simple

This is our "simple" keylogger written in python.

This is straightforward and can be copied/pasted into a python terminal to run.
The second to last line that starts with logging= needs some modification from your part. Where it says timeinterval put a number (in seconds), and where it says email and password input the email you wish to use as well as the password you will use for said email.
